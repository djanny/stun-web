With the IPv4 address exhaustion, and because of many security and other concerns the Internet users will connect more and more to the Internet through NAT and Packet Filters/Firewalls. Actually almost all service provider (e.g. mobile internet, homes) are using NAT. These environments makes hard or impossible the direct Real Time Communication (RTC) and this way we need a Standard based protocol called ICE that solves this traveral issue. ICE depends on STUN/TURN infrastructure.<br>The goal is in this pilot to demonstrate that a Europe wide STUN/TURN service could be build up from Open Source components to serve ICE agents, and RTC services like WebRTC and all in all our community.
